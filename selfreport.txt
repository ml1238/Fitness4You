Mike Lopez III - Fitness4U

Implementation:
I was not very involved in terms of implementation. Gerald took on the Web app part of the
demonstration, and Jason took care of the Python program that read the health data and outputted the
data correctly. In terms of implementation the most I did was introduce ideas, and bring up niche scenarios
that our program could run into.

Documentation:
This was a very different story, in terms of documentation of the GitHub page, other than the regular 
uploads of information from Gerald and Jason from their own programs, I was incharge with everything
GitHub related in terms of bi-weekly assignments, the pages, etc. Although this was not an agreement between
the team and I at the beginning of the project, as time went on it became an unspoken relationship where
I would take care of the GitHub page, and they would provide the program. I believe I was doing much less
work than the other two, hence my low score on all peer evaluations I submitted. I hope this does not
effect my grade too much, but I do understand if it will.
